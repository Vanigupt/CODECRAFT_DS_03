# CODECRAFT_DS_03
This repository contains my submission for Task 3 of the Data Science Internship at CodeCraft Infotech. The objective of this task was to build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.


# ğŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used is the [Bank Marketing Dataset](bank-additional.csv) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains information about customers contacted through marketing campaigns, including attributes such as age, job, marital status, education, and previous campaign outcomes.

# ğŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used
ğŸ”¹ Jupyter Notebook

ğŸ”¹ Pandas

ğŸ”¹ Scikit-learn 

ğŸ”¹ NumPy

ğŸ”¹ Matplotlib & Seaborn


## ğŸ§ª Task Objectives

- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Encode categorical variables
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Build a Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualize the decision tree

## ğŸ“ˆ Key Highlights

ğŸ”¹ Handled missing values and converted categorical variables using label/one-hot encoding  
ğŸ”¹ Performed feature selection and correlation analysis  
ğŸ”¹ Built a Decision Tree model with optimized parameters  
ğŸ”¹ Visualized feature importance and the decision tree structure  
ğŸ”¹ Achieved a good balance between accuracy and interpretability

# ğŸ§¾ Conclusion

The Decision Tree Classifier successfully learned patterns from the marketing data to predict customer responses. This task demonstrated the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation in the machine learning pipeline.
