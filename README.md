# CODECRAFT_DS_03
This repository contains my submission for Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at CodeCraft Infotech. The task focused on performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset to uncover patterns and relationships.

# ğŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used is the [Titanic Dataset](bank-additional.csv) from Kaggle, which includes passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, and survival status.

# ğŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used
ğŸ”¹ Jupyter Notebook

ğŸ”¹ Pandas

ğŸ”¹ NumPy

ğŸ”¹ Matplotlib & Seaborn

# ğŸ“ˆ EDA Highlights
ğŸ”¹ Cleaned missing values and corrected data types

ğŸ”¹ Analyzed distributions and relationships between features

ğŸ”¹ Visualized survival trends based on gender, age, and class

# ğŸ§¾ Conclusion

This analysis provided useful insights into survival patterns aboard the Titanic and demonstrated the importance of data preprocessing and visualization in understanding datasets.
